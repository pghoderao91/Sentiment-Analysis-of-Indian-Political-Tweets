# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Indian-Political-Tweets

### **Summary of the Project**
1. **Data Cleaning:**
-  We cleaned the tweets by removing unnecessary elements like links, special characters, Spaces and numbers that don't affect the sentiment

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**  
- Used VADER Sentiment Analyzer to calculate a sentiment score for each tweets
- Based on the compund scores we classfied each tweet as positive, neagtive or neutral

3. **Sentiment Distribution:**
- We visualized the overall sentiment distribution in the dataset using a bar chart, which showed that most tweets were positive, followed by negative and neutral tweets.

4. **Identifying Extreme Sentiments:**
- We identified the most positive and most negative tweets based on their sentiment scores. This helped highlight tweets with the strongest positive and negative emotions.

5. **Word Cloud Visualization:**
- We generated word clouds to visualize the most common words in positive and negative tweets.
-  The size of each word in the word cloud reflects how frequently it appeared in the tweets.

6. **Sentiment Prediction and Example Tweets:**
- We tested the sentiment analysis model by inputting a few example tweets that expressed positive views on governance and development in India.
- The model correctly predicted all these tweets as positive, with high sentiment scores (indicating strong positivity).
